# RAG-optimized_for_pdf_and_books_research
This project builds a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system from scratch using Google Colab. It allows you to upload books or PDF documents, extract and preprocess their content, convert the text into vector embeddings, store them in a searchable database, and use an LLM to answer questions based on the extracted information.
